# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

A problem I encountered during one of my projects in this course was determining which data structure to select for my final project.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by comparing the cons and pros of the three data structures. Take, for example, the vector data structure, the easiest to implement, but I thought that if the number of courses is input into the vector, it would take more time to search/ sort the vector. As for the hash table, a bit more time to implement, but it took less time to search for a specific course. A problem arose when trying to sort the courses in the hash table by alphanumerical order. The last data structure I believe to be the best option was because it sorted the courses as they were input into the binary search tree.  

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame roadblocks by rereading the textbook or using resources provided by the professor, like using YouTube videos or using Stack Overflow to better understand how to implement code throughout my projects.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software by better understanding how runtime affects code, using the data acquired to understand which data structure is better for the project.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

MY work on this project has helped me evolve the way I write projects by using pseudocode and flowcharts to better plan the way I execute code. By using these devices, I could see where my program would develop problems using one specific data structure but benefit from another.
